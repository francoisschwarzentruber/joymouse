# joymouse
Control your mouse pointer with a joystick (because your right hand has tendinopathy)

## Usage

Connect your joystick. Launch `python main.py`.
One button for clicking (drag and drop works!). One button for the right click. One button to change the speed of the mouse cursor (in the spirit that you change the speed of Mario).
